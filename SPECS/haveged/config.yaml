      detailed_description: 'A Linux entropy source using the HAVEGE algorithm  Haveged
        is a user space entropy daemon which is not dependent upon the standard mechanisms
        for harvesting randomness for the system entropy pool. This is important in
        systems with high entropy needs or limited user interaction (e.g. headless
        servers).  Haveged uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion)
        to maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill /dev/random whenever the
        supply of random bits in /dev/random falls below the low water mark of the
        device. The principle inputs to haveged are the sizes of the processor instruction
        and data caches used to setup the HAVEGE collector. The haveged default is
        a 4kb data cache and a 16kb instruction cache. On machines with a cpuid instruction,
        haveged will attempt to select appropriate values from internal tables. '
