      detailed_description: 'Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve
        as the central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically
        and transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned
        and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the
        capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers.
        Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent
        data loss. '
