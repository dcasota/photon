      detailed_description: 'OpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight
        Directory Access Protocol) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set
        of protocols for accessing directory services (usually phone book style information,
        but other information is possible) over the Internet, similar to the way DNS
        (Domain Name System) information is propagated over the Internet. The openldap
        package contains configuration files, libraries, and documentation for OpenLDAP. '
