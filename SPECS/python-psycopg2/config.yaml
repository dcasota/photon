      detailed_description: "Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter\
        \ for the Python programming language. Its main features are the complete\
        \ implementation of the Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety\
        \ (several threads can share the same connection). It was designed for heavily\
        \ multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and\
        \ make a large number of concurrent \u201CINSERT\u201Ds or \u201CUPDATE\u201D\
        s.  Psycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper, resulting in\
        \ being both efficient and secure. It features client-side and server-side\
        \ cursors, asynchronous communication and notifications, \u201CCOPY TO/COPY\
        \ FROM\u201D support. Many Python types are supported out-of-the-box and adapted\
        \ to matching PostgreSQL data types; adaptation can be extended and customized\
        \ thanks to a flexible objects adaptation system.  Psycopg 2 is both Unicode\
        \ and Python 3 friendly. "
