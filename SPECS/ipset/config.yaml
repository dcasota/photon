      detailed_description: 'IP sets are a framework inside the Linux kernel, which
        can be administered by the ipset utility. Depending on the type, an IP set
        may store IP addresses, networks, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, MAC addresses, interface
        names or combinations of them in a way, which ensures lightning speed when
        matching an entry against a set.  If you want to store multiple IP addresses
        or port numbers and match against the collection by iptables at one swoop;
        dynamically update iptables rules against IP addresses or ports without performance
        penalty; express complex IP address and ports based rulesets with one single
        iptables rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets then ipset may be the
        proper tool for you. '
