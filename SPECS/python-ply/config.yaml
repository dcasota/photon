      detailed_description: 'PLY is yet another implementation of lex and yacc for
        Python. Some notable features include the fact that its implemented entirely
        in Python and it uses LALR(1) parsing which is efficient and well suited for
        larger grammars.  PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including
        support for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support
        for ambiguous grammars.  PLY is extremely easy to use and provides very extensive
        error checking. It is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. '
