      detailed_description: 'Pyflakes is similar to PyChecker in scope, but differs
        in that it does not execute the modules to check them. This is both safer
        and faster, although it does not perform as many checks. Unlike PyLint, Pyflakes
        checks only for logical errors in programs; it does not perform any check
        on style. '
