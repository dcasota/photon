      detailed_description: 'Tcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration
        applications that tie together diverse applications, protocols, devices, and
        frameworks. When paired with the Tk toolkit, Tcl provides the fastest and
        most powerful way to create GUI applications that run on PCs, Unix, and Mac
        OS X. Tcl can also be used for a variety of web-related tasks and for creating
        powerful command languages for applications. '
