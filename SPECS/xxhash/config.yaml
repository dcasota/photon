      detailed_description: 'xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at
        RAM speed limits. It successfully completes the SMHasher test suite which
        evaluates collision, dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions.
        Code is highly portable, and hashes are identical on all platforms (little
        / big endian). '
