Subject: [PATCH 6/6] stalld: Fix single threaded mode starvation threshold
 check

starvation check for tasks in single threaded mode should be
>= config_starving_threshold. Otherwise, a task which is
starved for config_starving_threshold secs will not get boosted
unless it starves for atleast config_starving_threshold + config_granularity
secs if there was no boost happened or config_starving_threshold +
(config_granularity - config_boost_duration) if there was a boost happened.

[sshedi: port to stalld-1.17.1]
