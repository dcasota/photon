      detailed_description: The stalld program monitors the set of system threads,
        looking for threads that are ready-to-run but have not been given CPU time
        for some threshold period. When a starved thread is found, it is given a temporary
        boost using the SCHED_DEADLINE policy. The runtime given to such stalled threads
        is configurable by the user.
