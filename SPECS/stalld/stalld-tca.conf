#Boost tasks
#if there are threads by the name thread1,thread2

#Boost processes
#if there are processes by the name proc1,proc2

# Starving Threshold in seconds
# this value is the time the thread must be kept ready but not
# actually run to decide that the thread is starving
# ex: THRESH="-t 60"
THRESH="-t 2"

# Logging options
#
# Set logging to be some combination of:
#     --log_only
#     --log_kmsg
#     --log_syslog
#     --threaded_logging
#     or Nothing (default)
# ex: LOGONLY=--log_only
LOGGING=--threaded_logging

# Run in the foreground
# ex: FG=--foreground
# note: when using this should change the service Type to be simple
FG=--foreground

# Log Buffer Size
# This value holds the size of the log buffer to be used
# by the logging thread. It is used only when threaded logging
# is enabled
# eg. LB = "-B 1024"
LB=

# Use both boosting and migration to resolve stalls
# Kernel tasks and specified user tasks are boosted
# Remaining user tasks are moved to other CPUs
# ex: BM=--boost_and_migrate
BM=--boost_and_migrate

# Migration Attempts
# this value is the number of times miration will be
# attempted on a starving task. If migration fails
# boosting will be tried as a fallback
MA="-C 3"

# Write a pidfile
# ex: PF=--pidfile /run/stalld.pid
PF="--pidfile /run/stalld.pid"

# Force FIFO
# Force stalld to use SCHED_FIFO instead of SCHED_DEADLINE
# for doing priority boosting of starving tasks
# set FF="-F" to enable this
FF=

# Set config granularity in seconds
# ex: CG="-g 2"
CG="-g 2"

# Set Backend
# ex: BE="-b Q" for eBPF based backend
#     BE="-b S" for /proc/sched/debug based backend
#     BE=       # empty means default /proc/sched/debug will be selected.
