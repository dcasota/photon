      detailed_description: 'getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API. It implements
        DNS entry points from a design developed and vetted by application developers,
        in an API specification edited by Paul Hoffman. With the development of this
        API, we intend to offer application developers a modernized and flexible way
        to access DNS security (DNSSEC) and other powerful new DNS features; a particular
        hope is to inspire application developers towards innovative security solutions
        in their applications. '
