Subject: [PATCH] web: Fix an open redirect in StaticFileHandler

Under some configurations the default_filename redirect could be exploited
to redirect to an attacker-controlled site. This change refuses to redirect
to URLs that could be misinterpreted.

A test case for the specific vulnerable configuration will follow after the
patch has been available.
