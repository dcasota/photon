Subject: [PATCH] gvariant: Propagate trust when getting a child of a
 serialised variant

If a variant is trusted, that means all its children are trusted, so
ensure that their checked offsets are set as such.

This allows a lot of the offset table checks to be avoided when getting
children from trusted serialised tuples, which speeds things up.

No unit test is included because this is just a performance fix. If
there are other slownesses, or regressions, in serialised `GVariant`
performance, the fuzzing setup will catch them like it did this one.

This change does reduce the time to run the oss-fuzz reproducer from 80s
to about 0.7s on my machine.

Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <pwithnall@endlessos.org>

Fixes: #2841
oss-fuzz#54314

Fixes regresions introduced by the first set of patches. Regressions
identified with CVE-2023-32643 and CVE-2023-32636
