Subject: [PATCH 06/16] gdbusprivate: Add symbolic constants for the message
 bus itself

Using these is a bit more clearly correct than repeating them everywhere.
To avoid excessive diffstat in a branch for a bug fix, I'm not
immediately replacing all existing occurrences of the same literals with
these names.

The names of these constants are chosen to be consistent with libdbus,
despite using somewhat outdated terminology (D-Bus now uses the term
"well-known bus name" for what used to be called a service name,
reserving the word "service" to mean specifically the programs that
have .service files and participate in service activation).
