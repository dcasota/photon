      detailed_description: 'This is a collection of ''.pl'' files that were bundled
        with the Perl core until core version 5.15.1. Relying on their presence in
        the core distribution is deprecated; they should be acquired from this CPAN
        distribution instead. From core version 5.13.3 until their removal, the core
        versions of these libraries emit a deprecation warning when loaded. The CPAN
        version does not emit such a warning. '
