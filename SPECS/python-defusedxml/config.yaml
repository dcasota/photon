      detailed_description: 'The results of an attack on a vulnerable XML library
        can be fairly dramatic. With just a few hundred Bytes of XML data an attacker
        can occupy several Gigabytes of memory within seconds. An attacker can also
        keep CPUs busy for a long time with a small to medium size request. Under
        some circumstances it is even possible to access local files on your server,
        to circumvent a firewall, or to abuse services to rebound attacks to third
        parties.  The attacks use and abuse less common features of XML and its parsers.
        The majority of developers are unacquainted with features such as processing
        instructions and entity expansions that XML inherited from SGML. At best they
        know about <!DOCTYPE> from experience with HTML but they are not aware that
        a document type definition (DTD) can generate an HTTP request or load a file
        from the file system.  None of the issues is new. They have been known for
        a long time. Billion laughs was first reported in 2003. Nevertheless some
        XML libraries and applications are still vulnerable and even heavy users of
        XML are surprised by these features. It''s hard to say whom to blame for the
        situation. It''s too short sighted to shift all blame on XML parsers and XML
        libraries for using insecure default settings. After all they properly implement
        XML specifications. Application developers must not rely that a library is
        always configured for security and potential harmful data by default. '
