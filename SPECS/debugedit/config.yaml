      detailed_description: 'The debugedit project provides programs and scripts for
        creating debuginfo and source file distributions, collect build-ids and rewrite
        source paths in DWARF data for debugging, tracing and profiling.  It is based
        on code originally from the rpm project plus libiberty and binutils.  It depends
        on the elfutils libelf and libdw libraries to read and write ELF files, DWARF
        data and build-ids. '
