      detailed_description: 'Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written
        in Python, for human beings.  Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP
        requests are extremely verbose and cumbersome. Python''s builtin urllib2 module
        provides most of the HTTP capabilities you should need, but the api is thoroughly
        broken. It requires an enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to
        perform the simplest of tasks.  Features:  - Extremely simple GET, HEAD, POST,
        PUT, DELETE Requests + Simple HTTP Header Request Attachment + Simple Data/Params
        Request Attachment + Simple Multipart File Uploads + CookieJar Support + Redirection
        History + Redirection Recursion Urllib Fix + Auto Decompression of GZipped
        Content + Unicode URL Support - Simple Authentication + Simple URL + HTTP
