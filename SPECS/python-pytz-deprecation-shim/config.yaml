      detailed_description: "pytz has served the Python community well for many years,\
        \ but it is no longer the best option for providing time zones. pytz has a\
        \ non-standard interface that is very easy to misuse; this interface was necessary\
        \ when pytz was created, because datetime had no way to represent ambiguous\
        \ datetimes, but this was solved in Python 3.6, which added a fold attribute\
        \ to datetimes in PEP 495. With the addition of the zoneinfo module in Python\
        \ 3.9 (PEP 615), there has never been a better time to migrate away from pytz.\
        \  However, since pytz time zones are used very differently from a standard\
        \ tzinfo, and many libraries have built pytz zones into their standard time\
        \ zone interface (and thus may have users relying on the existence of the\
        \ localize and normalize methods); this library provides shim classes that\
        \ are compatible with both PEP 495 and pytz\u2019s interface, to make it easier\
        \ for libraries to deprecate pytz. "
