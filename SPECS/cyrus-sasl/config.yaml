      detailed_description: 'The Cyrus SASL package contains a Simple Authentication
        and Security Layer, a method for adding authentication support to connection-based
        protocols. To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
        authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection
        of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security
        layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection. '
