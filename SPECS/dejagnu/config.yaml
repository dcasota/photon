      detailed_description: 'DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its
        purpose is to provide a single front end for all tests. Think of it as a custom
        library of Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a test harness. A test
        harness is the testing infrastructure that is created to support a specific
        program or tool. Each program can have multiple testsuites, all supported
        by a single test harness. DejaGnu is written in Expect, which in turn uses
        Tcl. '
