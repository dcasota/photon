      detailed_description: 'This package contains a utility for interfacing with
        devices that support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface specification.  IPMI
        is an open standard for machine health, inventory, and remote power control.  This
        utility can communicate with IPMI-enabled devices through either a kernel
        driver such as OpenIPMI or over the RMCP LAN protocol defined in the IPMI
        specification.  IPMIv2 adds support for encrypted LAN communications and remote
        Serial-over-LAN functionality.  It provides commands for reading the Sensor
        Data Repository (SDR) and displaying sensor values, displaying the contents
        of the System Event Log (SEL), printing Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) information,
        reading and setting LAN configuration, and chassis power control. '
