      detailed_description: 'This package contains SunLib''s implementation of transport-independent
        RPC (TI-RPC) documentation.  This library forms a piece of the base of Open
        Network Computing (ONC), and is derived directly from the Solaris 2.3 source.  TI-RPC
        is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V Transport
        Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface (XTI).  TI-RPC
        is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported by almost 70
        vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code (RPCSRC 4.0) remains
        available from several internet sites. '
