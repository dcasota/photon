      detailed_description: 'ipvsadm is used to setup, maintain, and inspect the virtual
        server table in the Linux kernel. The Linux Virtual Server can be used to
        build scalable network services based on a cluster of two or more nodes. The
        active node of the cluster redirects service requests to a collection of server
        hosts that will actually perform the services.  Supported Features include:
        two protocols (TCP and UDP), three packet-forwarding methods (NAT, tunneling,
        and direct routing), and eight load balancing algorithms (round robin  weighted
        round robin, least-connection, weighted least-connection, locality-based least-connection,
        locality-based least-connection with replication, destination-hashing, and
        source-hashing). '
