      detailed_description: 'dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information
        inserted in ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers
        such as GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.  Utilities in the dwarves
        suite include pahole, that can be used to find alignment holes in structs
        and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not limited to these.  It also
        extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping pack those
        structures to achieve more cache hits.  These tools can also be used to encode
        and read the BTF type information format used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall,
        using ''pahole -J'' and ''pahole -F btf''.  A diff like tool, codiff can be
        used to compare the effects changes in source code generate on the resulting
        binaries.  Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information
        about functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.  One
        example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers pfunct
        to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using gcc,
        with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the original
        .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same debug
        info.  Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty
        print raw data according to command line directions.  Headers can have its
        data format described from debugging info and offsets from it can be used
        to further format a number of records.  The btfdiff utility compares the output
        of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make sure they produce the same results. '
