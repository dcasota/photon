      detailed_description: 'Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter''s external-facing
        features including renaming imported functions with the -as, -prefix and -suffix
        options; explicit destinations with the into option; and alternative installers
        with the installer option. But it''s written in only about 40%% as many lines
        of code and with zero non-core dependencies.  Its internal-facing interface
        is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration done through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK
        and %%EXPORT_TAGS package variables.  Exporter::Tiny performs most of its
        internal duties (including resolution of tag names to sub names, resolution
        of sub names to coderefs, and installation of coderefs into the target package)
        as method calls, which means they can be overridden to provide interesting
        behavior. '
