      detailed_description: 'The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable
        compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to
        do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries
        that can be used to build them. The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym;
        it is the full name of the project. '
