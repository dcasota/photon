      detailed_description: 'Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
        monitoring.  Libpcap can provide network statistics collection, security monitoring
        and network debugging.  Since almost every system vendor provides a different
        interface for packet capture, the libpcap authors created this system-independent
        API to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several system-dependent
        packet capture modules in each application.  Install libpcap if you need to
        do low-level network traffic monitoring on your network. '
