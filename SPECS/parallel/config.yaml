      detailed_description: 'GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs concurrently
        locally or using remote computers. A job is typically a single command or
        a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
        typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list
        of URLs, or a list of tables. '
