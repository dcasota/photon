      detailed_description: 'The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming
        with posix capabilities much easier than the traditional libcap library. It
        includes utilities that can analyse all currently running applications and
        print out any capabilities and whether or not it has an open ended bounding
        set. An open bounding set without the securebits "NOROOT" flag will allow
        full capabilities escalation for apps retaining uid 0 simply by calling execve. '
