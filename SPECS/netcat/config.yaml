      detailed_description: 'Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and
        writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed
        to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven
        by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network
        debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection
        you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. '
