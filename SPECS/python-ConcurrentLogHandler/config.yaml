      detailed_description: "ConcurrentLogHandler is a module that provides an additional\
        \ log handler for Python\u2019s standard logging package (PEP 282). This handler\
        \ will write log events to log file which is rotated when the log file reaches\
        \ a certain size. Multiple processes can safely write to the same log file\
        \ concurrently. "
