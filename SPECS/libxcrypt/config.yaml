      detailed_description: 'libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of
        passwords. It supports a wide variety of both modern and historical hashing
        methods: yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt,
        md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt. It provides
        the traditional Unix crypt and crypt_r interfaces, as well as a set of extended
        interfaces pioneered by Openwall Linux, crypt_rn, crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt,
        crypt_gensalt_rn, and crypt_gensalt_ra.  libxcrypt is intended to be used
        by login(1), passwd(1), and other similar programs; that is, to hash a small
        number of passwords during an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.
        It is not suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
        other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of sensitive
        data. However, it is intended to be fast and lightweight enough for use in
        servers that must field thousands of login attempts per minute. '
