      detailed_description: 'Dstat gives you detailed selective information in columns
        and clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed.
        Less confusion, less mistakes. And most importantly, it makes it very easy
        to write plugins to collect your own counters and extend in ways you never
        expected. '
