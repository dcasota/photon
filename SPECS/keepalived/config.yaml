      detailed_description: 'The main goal of the keepalived project is to add a strong
        & robust keepalive facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project
        is written in C with multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements
        a framework based on three family checks : Layer3, Layer4 & Layer5/7. This
        framework gives the daemon the ability to check the state of an LVS server
        pool. When one of the servers of the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs
        the linux kernel via a setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the
        LVS topology. In addition keepalived implements an independent VRRPv2 stack
        to handle director failover. So in short keepalived is a userspace daemon
        for LVS cluster nodes healthchecks and LVS directors failover. '
