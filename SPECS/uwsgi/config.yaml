      detailed_description: 'The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for
        building hosting services. Application servers (for various programming languages
        and protocols), proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented
        using a common api and a common configuration style.  Thanks to its pluggable
        architecture it can be extended to support more platforms and languages. Currently,
        you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.  The "WSGI" part in the name
        is a tribute to the namesake Python standard, as it has been the first developed
        plugin for the project. Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability
        are the strengths of the project (and the only rules followed). '
