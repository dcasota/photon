        \ kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed\
        \ to add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux\
        \ kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to improve\
        \ the security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components\
        \ provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access\
        \ control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement\xAE\
        , Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security. "
