      detailed_description: 'PrettyTable is a simple Python library designed to make
        it quick and easy to represent tabular data in visually appealing ASCII tables.
        It was inspired by the ASCII tables used in the PostgreSQL shell psql. PrettyTable
        allows for selection of which columns are to be printed, independent alignment
        of columns (left or right justified or centred) and printing of "sub-tables"
        by specifying a row range. '
