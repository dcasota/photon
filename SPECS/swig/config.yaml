      detailed_description: 'Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is
        a software development tool for connecting C, C++ and Objective C programs
        with a variety of high-level programming languages.  SWIG is primarily used
        with Perl, Python and Tcl/TK, but it has also been extended to Java, Eiffel
        and Guile. SWIG is normally used to create high-level interpreted programming
        environments, systems integration, and as a tool for building user interfaces '
