      detailed_description: 'Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching
        library. It follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre
        library, but is a standalone library with its own C API.  Hyperscan uses hybrid
        automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of large numbers (up to
        tens of thousands) of regular expressions and for the matching of regular
        expressions across streams of data.  Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI
        library stack. '
