      detailed_description: 'RootlessKit is a Linux-native implementation of "fake
        root" using user_namespaces(7). The purpose of RootlessKit is to run Docker
        and Kubernetes as an unprivileged user (known as "Rootless mode"), so as to
        protect the real root on the host from potential container-breakout attacks. '
