      detailed_description: 'CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match
        certain security-oriented characteristics. You can use CrackLib to stop users
        from choosing passwords which would be easy to guess. CrackLib performs certain
        tests:  * It tries to generate words from a username and gecos entry and checks
        those words against the password; * It checks for simplistic patterns in passwords;
        * It checks for the password in a dictionary.  CrackLib is actually a library
        containing a particular C function which is used to check the password, as
        well as other C functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for a passwd program;
        it must be used in conjunction with an existing passwd program.  Install the
        cracklib package if you need a program to check users'' passwords to see if
        they are at least minimally secure. If you install CrackLib, you''ll also
        want to install the cracklib-dicts package. '
