      detailed_description: 'jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation
        that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support.
        jemalloc first came into use as the FreeBSD libc allocator in 2005, and since
        then it has found its way into numerous applications that rely on its predictable
        behavior. In 2010 jemalloc development efforts broadened to include developer
        support features such as heap profiling and extensive monitoring/tuning hooks.
        Modern jemalloc releases continue to be integrated back into FreeBSD, and
        therefore versatility remains critical. Ongoing development efforts trend
        toward making jemalloc among the best allocators for a broad range of demanding
        applications, and eliminating/mitigating weaknesses that have practical repercussions
        for real world applications. '
