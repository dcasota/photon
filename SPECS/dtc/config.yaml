      detailed_description: 'Devicetree is a data structure for describing hardware.
        Rather than hard coding every detail of a device into an operating system,
        many aspects of the hardware can be described in a data structure that is
        passed to the operating system at boot time. The devicetree is used by OpenFirmware,
        OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer (OPAL), Power Architecture Platform Requirements
        (PAPR) and in the standalone Flattened Device Tree (FDT) form. '
