      detailed_description: 'Socat is a command line based utility that establishes
        two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them. Because the
        streams can be constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks
        and sources (see address types), and because lots of address options may be
        applied to the streams, socat can be used for many different purposes. '
