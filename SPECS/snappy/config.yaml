      detailed_description: 'Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does
        not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
        library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression.
        For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of
        magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere
        from 20% to 100% bigger. '
