      detailed_description: 'pyudev is a LGPL licensed, pure Python binding for libudev,
        the device and hardware management and information library for Linux. It supports
        almost all libudev functionality. You can enumerate devices, query device
        properties and attributes or monitor devices, including asynchronous monitoring
        with threads, or within the event loops of Qt, Glib or wxPython.  The binding
        supports CPython 2 (2.6 or newer) and 3 (3.1 or newer), and PyPy 1.5 or newer.
        It is tested against udev 151 or newer, earlier versions of udev as found
        on dated Linux systems may work, but are not officially supported. '
