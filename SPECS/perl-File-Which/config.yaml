      detailed_description: File::Which finds the full or relative paths to executable
        programs on the system. This is normally the function of which utility. which
        is typically implemented as either a program or a built in shell command.
        On some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows it is not provided as part of
        the core operating system. This module provides a consistent API to this functionality
        regardless of the underlying platform.  The focus of this module is correctness
        and portability. As a consequence platforms where the current directory is
        implicitly part of the search path such as Microsoft Windows will find executables
        in the current directory, whereas on platforms such as UNIX where this is
        not the case executables in the current directory will only be found if the
        current directory is explicitly added to the path.  If you need a portable
        which on the command line in an environment that does not provide it, install
        App::pwhich which provides a command line interface to this API.
