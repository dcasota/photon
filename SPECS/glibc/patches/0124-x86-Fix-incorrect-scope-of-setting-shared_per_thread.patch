Subject: [PATCH 124/147] x86: Fix incorrect scope of setting
 `shared_per_thread` [BZ# 30745]

The:

```
    if (shared_per_thread > 0 && threads > 0)
      shared_per_thread /= threads;
```

Code was accidentally moved to inside the else scope.  This doesn't
match how it was previously (before af992e7abd).

This patch fixes that by putting the division after the `else` block.

(cherry picked from commit 084fb31bc2c5f95ae0b9e6df4d3cf0ff43471ede)
