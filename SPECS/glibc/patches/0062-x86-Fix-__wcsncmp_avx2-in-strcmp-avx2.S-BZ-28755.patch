Subject: [PATCH 062/147] x86: Fix __wcsncmp_avx2 in strcmp-avx2.S [BZ# 28755]

Fixes [BZ# 28755] for wcsncmp by redirecting length >= 2^56 to
__wcscmp_avx2. For x86_64 this covers the entire address range so any
length larger could not possibly be used to bound `s1` or `s2`.

test-strcmp, test-strncmp, test-wcscmp, and test-wcsncmp all pass.

(cherry picked from commit ddf0992cf57a93200e0c782e2a94d0733a5a0b87)
