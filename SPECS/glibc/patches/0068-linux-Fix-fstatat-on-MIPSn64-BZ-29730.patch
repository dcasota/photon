Subject: [PATCH 068/175] linux: Fix fstatat on MIPSn64 (BZ #29730)

Commit 6e8a0aac2f883 ("time: Fix overflow itimer tests on 32-bit
systems") changed in_time_t_range to assume a 32-bit time_t. This broke
fstatat on MIPSn64 that was using it with a 64-bit time_t due to
difference between stat and stat64. This commit fix that by adding a
MIPSn64 specific version, which bypasses the EOVERFLOW tests.

Resolves: BZ #29730

Reviewed-by: Adhemerval Zanella  <adhemerval.zanella@linaro.org>
(cherry picked from commit 7457b7eef8dfe8cc48e55b9f9837df6dd397b80d)
