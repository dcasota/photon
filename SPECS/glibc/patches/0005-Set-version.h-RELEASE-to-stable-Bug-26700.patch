Subject: [PATCH 005/147] Set version.h RELEASE to "stable" (Bug 26700)

The RELEASE macro was accidentaly set to "release" instead of
the expected "stable" by the release manager.  This is a mistake
that leads to the build using "-g -O1" instead of "-g -O2" if
configure was executed with "CFLAGS=" (CFLAGS set but empty).
