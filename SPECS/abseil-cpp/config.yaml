      detailed_description: 'Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ library code
        designed to augment the C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected
        from Google''s own C++ code base, has been extensively tested and used in
        production, and is the same code we depend on in our daily coding lives.  In
        some cases, Abseil provides pieces missing from the C++ standard; in others,
        Abseil provides alternatives to the standard for special needs we''ve found
        through usage in the Google code base. We denote those cases clearly within
        the library code we provide you.  Abseil is not meant to be a competitor to
        the standard library; we''ve just found that many of these utilities serve
        a purpose within our code base, and we now want to provide those resources
        to the C++ community as a whole. '
