      detailed_description: 'Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and
        directory specifications (strings describing their locations, like ''/home/ken/foo.txt''
        or ''C:\Windows\Foo.txt'') in a cross-platform manner. It supports pretty
        much every platform Perl runs on, including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc,
        Cygwin, OS/2, and NetWare.  The well-known module File::Spec also provides
        this service, but it''s sort of awkward to use well, so people sometimes avoid
        it, or use it in a way that won''t actually work properly on platforms significantly
        different than the ones they''ve tested their code on. '
