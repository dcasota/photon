      detailed_description: 'LAPACK is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines
        for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
        of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.
        The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized
        Schur) are also provided, as are related computations such as reordering of
        the Schur factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded
        matrices are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar
        functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and
        double precision. '
