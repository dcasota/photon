      detailed_description: 'RE2 is a C++ library providing a fast, safe, thread-friendly
        alternative to backtracking regular expression engines like those used in
        PCRE, Perl, and Python.  Backtracking engines are typically full of features
        and convenient syntactic sugar but can be forced into taking exponential amounts
        of time on even small inputs.  In contrast, RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee
        that regular expression searches run in time linear in the size of the input,
        at the expense of some missing features (e.g back references and generalized
        assertions). '
