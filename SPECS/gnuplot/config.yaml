      detailed_description: 'Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility
        for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source
        code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don''t have to pay for
        it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize
        mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many
        non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting
        engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported
        and under active development since 1986. '
