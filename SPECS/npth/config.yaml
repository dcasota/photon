      detailed_description: 'This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus
        a non-preemptive threads implementation. In contrast to GNU Pth, it is based
        on the system''s standard threads implementation. This allows the use of libraries
        which are not compatible to GNU Pth. Experience with a Windows Pth emulation
        showed that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based framework. '
