      detailed_description: 'The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
        provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...)
        of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
        nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also
        gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as
        well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand
        HCAs or GPUs. '
