      detailed_description: "Support for the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications\
        \ (IDNA) protocol as specified in RFC 5891. This is the latest version of\
        \ the protocol and is sometimes referred to as \u201CIDNA 2008\u201D.  This\
        \ library also provides support for Unicode Technical Standard 46, Unicode\
        \ IDNA Compatibility Processing.  This acts as a suitable replacement for\
        \ the \u201Cencodings.idna\u201D module that comes with the Python standard\
        \ library, but only supports the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC 3490). "
