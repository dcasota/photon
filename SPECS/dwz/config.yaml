      detailed_description: 'The dwz package contains a program that attempts to optimize
        DWARF debugging information contained in ELF shared libraries and ELF executables
        for size, by replacing DWARF information representation with equivalent smaller
        representation where possible and by reducing the amount of duplication using
        techniques from DWARF standard appendix E - creating DW_TAG_partial_unit compilation
        units (CUs) for duplicated information and using DW_TAG_imported_unit to import
        it into each CU that needs it. '
