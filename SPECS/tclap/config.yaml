      detailed_description: 'TCLAP is a small, flexible library that provides a simple
        interface for defining and accessing command line arguments. It was intially
        inspired by the user friendly CLAP libary. The difference is that this library
        is templatized, so the argument class is type independent. Type independence
        avoids identical-except-for-type objects, such as IntArg, FloatArg, and StringArg.
        While the library is not strictly compliant with the GNU or POSIX standards,
        it is close. '
