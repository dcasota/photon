      detailed_description: 'The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the
        simple syslog() API provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between
        EventLog and syslog is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.  EventLog
        provides an interface to build, format and output an event record. The exact
        format and output method can be customized by the administrator via a configuration
        file.  This package is the runtime part of the library. '
