      detailed_description: 'RSYSLOG is the rocket-fast system for log processing.
        It offers high-performance, great security features and a modular design.
        While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a kind of
        swiss army knife of logging, being able to accept inputs from a wide variety
        of sources, transform them, and output to the results to diverse destinations. '
