      detailed_description: 'ipref is a network performance measurement tool that
        can measure the maximum achievable network bandwidth on IP networks. It supports
        tuning of various parameters related to timing, protocols, and buffers.  For
        each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. '
