      detailed_description: 'Distlib contains the implementations of the packaging
        PEPs and other low-level features which relate to packaging, distribution
        and deployment of Python software. If Distlib can be made genuinely useful,
        then it is possible for third-party packaging tools to transition to using
        it. Their developers and users then benefit from standardised implementation
        of low-level functions, time saved by not having to reinvent wheels, and improved
        interoperability between tools. '
