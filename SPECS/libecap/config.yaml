      detailed_description: 'eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application,
        such as an HTTP proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and
        adaptation to a loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being
        processed, an eCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to
        the adaptation module and gets back an adapted message, a "not interested"
        response, or a "block this message now!" instruction. These exchanges often
        include message bodies.  The adaptation module can also exchange meta-information
        with the host application to supply additional details such as configuration
        options, a reason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus
        name.  If you are familiar with the ICAP protocol (RFC 3507), then you may
        think of eCAP as an "embedded ICAP", where network interactions with an ICAP
        server are replaced with function calls to an adaptation module. '
