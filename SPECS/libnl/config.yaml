      detailed_description: 'The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing
        APIs to netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces. Netlink is a IPC mechanism
        primarly between the kernel and user space processes. It was designed to be
        a more flexible successor to ioctl to provide mainly networking related kernel
        configuration and monitoring interfaces. '
