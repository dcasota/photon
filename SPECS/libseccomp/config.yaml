      detailed_description: 'The libseccomp library provides an easy to use, platform
        independent, interface to the Linux Kernel syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp.
        The libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall
        filter language and present a more conventional function-call based filtering
        interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application developers. '
