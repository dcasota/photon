      detailed_description: 'libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented
        to Netlink developers. There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating,
        constructing of both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy
        to get wrong. This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you
        to re-use code and to avoid re-inventing the wheel. '
