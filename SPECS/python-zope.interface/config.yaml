      detailed_description: "This package is intended to be independently reusable\
        \ in any Python project. It is maintained by the Zope Toolkit project.  This\
        \ package provides an implementation of \u201Cobject interfaces\u201D for\
        \ Python. Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to\
        \ a given API or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation\
        \ of the Design By Contract methodology support in Python.  For detailed documentation,\
        \ please visit http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface "
