      detailed_description: "Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux\xAE\
        \ kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed\
        \ to add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux\
        \ kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to improve\
        \ the security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components\
        \ provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access\
        \ control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement\xAE\
        , Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.  libselinux provides\
        \ an API for SELinux applications to get and set process and file security\
        \ contexts and to obtain security policy decisions.  Required for any applications\
        \ that use the SELinux API. "
