      detailed_description: 'LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
        speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU.  It features an
        extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching
        RAM speed limits on multi-core systems. '
