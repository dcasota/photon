      detailed_description: 'Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for
        Unix platforms which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for
        multiple threads of execution (aka ``multithreading'''') inside event-driven
        applications. All threads run in the same address space of the server application,
        but each thread has it''s own individual program-counter, run-time stack,
        signal mask and errno variable. '
