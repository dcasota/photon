      detailed_description: 'Git is a free and open source, distributed version control
        system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
        speed and efficiency. Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete
        history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network
        access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.
        Git is used for version control of files, much like tools such as Mercurial,
        Bazaar, Subversion-1.7.8, CVS-1.11.23, Perforce, and Team Foundation Server. '
