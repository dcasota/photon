      detailed_description: 'Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent
        and beautiful documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting
        of multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was originally
        created to translate the new Python documentation, but has now been cleaned
        up in the hope that it will be useful to many other projects. '
