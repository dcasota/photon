      detailed_description: 'Meson is an open source build system meant to be both
        extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.
        The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing
        or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every second spent
        waiting for the build system to actually start compiling code. '
