      detailed_description: 'The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes system
        settings dynamically. It does so by monitoring the usage of several system
        components periodically. Based on that information components will then be
        put into lower or higher power saving modes to adapt to the current usage.
        Currently only ethernet network and ATA harddisk devices are implemented. '
