      detailed_description: 'cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
        cereal takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into different
        representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal was
        designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external
        dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used standalone. '
