      detailed_description: 'dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost
        all record types. It can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic
        updates. It supports TSIG authenticated messages and EDNS0.  dnspython provides
        both high and low level access to DNS. The high level classes perform queries
        for data of a given name, type, and class, and return an answer set. The low
        level classes allow direct manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and
        records.  dnspython originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate
        the testing of DNS software. Nominum has generously allowed it to be open
        sourced under a BSD-style license. '
