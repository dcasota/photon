      detailed_description: 'The ssh library was designed to be used by programmers
        needing a working SSH implementation by the mean of a library. The complete
        control of the client is made by the programmer. With %{name}, you can remotely
        execute programs, transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for
        your remote programs. With its Secure FTP implementation, you can play with
        remote files easily, without third-party programs others than libcrypto (from
        openssl). '
