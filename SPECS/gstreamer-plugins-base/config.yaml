      detailed_description: 'GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs
        of filters which operate on media data. Applications using this library can
        do anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about
        anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new
        data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new
        plug-ins. '
