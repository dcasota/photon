      detailed_description: 'gpsd is a service daemon that mediates access to a GPS
        sensor connected to the host computer by serial or USB interface, making its
        data on the location/course/velocity of the sensor available to be queried
        on TCP port 2947 of the host computer.  With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications
        (such as navigational and wardriving software) can share access to a GPS without
        contention or loss of data.  Also, gpsd responds to queries with a format
        that is substantially easier to parse than NMEA 0183. '
