      detailed_description: 'Password management should be simple and follow Unix
        philosophy. With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file
        whose filename is the title of the website or resource that requires the password.
        These encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies,
        copied from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard
        command line file management utilities. '
