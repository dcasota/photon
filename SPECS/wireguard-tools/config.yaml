      detailed_description: 'WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel
        and uses state-of-the-art cryptography (the "Noise" protocol). It aims to
        be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the
        massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.
        WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
        and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. It runs over
        UDP.  This package provides the wg binary for controlling WireGuard. '
