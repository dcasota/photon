      detailed_description: 'NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed
        to efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary records
        without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional arrays. NumPy
        is built on the Numeric code base and adds features introduced by numarray
        as well as an extended C-API and the ability to create arrays of arbitrary
        type which also makes NumPy suitable for interfacing with general-purpose
        data-base applications. '
