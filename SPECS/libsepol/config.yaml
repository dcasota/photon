      detailed_description: "Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux\xAE\
        \ kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed\
        \ to add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux\
        \ kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to improve\
        \ the security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components\
        \ provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access\
        \ control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement\xAE\
        , Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.  libsepol provides\
        \ an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies. It is used by checkpolicy\
        \ (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well as by programs like load_policy\
        \ that need to perform specific transformations on binary policies such as\
        \ customizing policy boolean settings. "
