      detailed_description: 'S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer''s library designed
        to allow a developer to create robust multi-platform software. It provides
        facilities required by interactive applications such as display/screen management,
        keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. The most exciting feature of the library
        is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program to make
        it extensible. While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of
        the interpreter, it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the
        use of slsh, which is part of the S-Lang distribution.  Unlike many interpreters,
        the S-Lang interpreter supports all of the native C integer types (signed
        and unsigned versions of char, short, int, long, and long long), and both
        single and double precision types, as well as a double precision complex type.
        Other data types supported by the interpreter include strings, lists, associative
        arrays (hashes), user-defined structures, and multi-dimensional arrays of
        any data-type.  The S-Lang interpreter has very strong support for array-based
        operations making it ideal for numerical applications. '
