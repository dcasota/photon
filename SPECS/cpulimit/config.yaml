      detailed_description: 'cpulimit is a simple program which attempts to limit
        the CPU usage of a process (expressed in percentage, not in CPU time). This
        is useful to control batch jobs, when you don''t want them to eat too much
        CPU. It does not act on the nice value or other scheduling priority stuff,
        but on the real CPU usage. Also, it is able to adapt itself to the overall
        system load, dynamically and quickly. '
