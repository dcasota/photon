      detailed_description: 'LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written
        in ANSI C. It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression.
        Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower compression
        levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio while still decompressing
        at this very high speed. '
