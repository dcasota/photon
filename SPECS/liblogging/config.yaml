      detailed_description: 'liblogging (the upstream project) is a collection of
        several components. Namely: stdlog, journalemu, rfc3195. The stdlog component
        of liblogging can be viewed as an enhanced version of the syslog(3) API. It
        retains the easy semantics, but makes the API more sophisticated "behind the
        scenes" with better support for multiple threads and flexibility for different
        log destinations (e.g. syslog and systemd journal). '
