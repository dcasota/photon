      detailed_description: 'Portable and efficient C programming interface (API)
        to determine the call-chain of a program. The API additionally provides the
        means to manipulate the preserved (callee-saved) state of each call-frame,
        and to resume execution at any point in the call-chain (non-local goto). The
        API supports both local (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation.
        As such, the API is useful in a number of applications. '
