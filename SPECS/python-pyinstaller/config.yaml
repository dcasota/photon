      detailed_description: "PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its\
        \ dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without\
        \ installing a Python interpreter or any modules. PyInstaller reads a Python\
        \ script written by you. It analyzes your code to discover every other module\
        \ and library your script needs in order to execute. Then it collects copies\
        \ of all those files \u2013 including the active Python interpreter! \u2013\
        \ and puts them with your script in a single folder, or optionally in a single\
        \ executable file. PyInstaller is tested against Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\
        \ However, it is not a cross-compiler: to make a Windows app you run PyInstaller\
        \ in Windows; to make a Linux app you run it in Linux, etc. PyInstaller has\
        \ been used successfully with AIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD, but is not tested\
        \ against them. "
