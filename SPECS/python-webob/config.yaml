      detailed_description: 'WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.
        Specifically it does this by wrapping the WSGI request environment and response
        status/headers/app_iter(body).  The request and response objects provide many
        conveniences for parsing HTTP request and forming HTTP responses. Both objects
        are read/write: as a result, WebOb is also a nice way to create HTTP requests
        and parse HTTP responses. '
