      detailed_description: 'The %{name} package contains an inter process communication
        library used by some of the other GnuPG related packages. %{name}''s primary
        use is to allow a client to interact with a non-persistent server. %{name}
        is not, however, limited to use with GnuPG servers and clients. It was designed
        to be flexible enough to meet the demands of many transaction based environments
        with non-persistent servers. '
