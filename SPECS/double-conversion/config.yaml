      detailed_description: 'This project (double-conversion) provides binary-decimal
        and decimal-binary routines for IEEE doubles. The library consists of efficient
        conversion routines that have been extracted from the V8 JavaScript engine.The
        code has been refactored and improved so that it can be used more easily in
        other projects. '
