      detailed_description: 'Provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote
        directories and authentication mechanisms. It provides an NSS and PAM interface
        toward the system and a pluggable back end system to connect to multiple different
        account sources. It is also the basis to provide client auditing and policy
        services for projects like FreeIPA.  The sssd subpackage is a meta-package
        that contains the daemon as well as all the existing back ends. '
