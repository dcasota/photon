      detailed_description: 'Contains the kpatch utility, which allows loading of
        kernel livepatches. kpatch is a Linux dynamic kernel patching tool which allows
        you to patch a running kernel without rebooting or restarting any processes.  It
        enables sysadmins to apply critical security patches to the kernel immediately,
        without having to wait for long-running tasks to complete, users to log off,
        or for scheduled reboot windows.  It gives more control over up-time without
        sacrificing security or stability. '
