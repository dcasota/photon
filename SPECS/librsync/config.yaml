      detailed_description: 'librsync implements the "rsync" algorithm, which allows
        remote differencing of binary files.  librsync computes a delta relative to
        a file''s checksum, so the two files need not both be present to generate
        a delta.  This library was previously known as libhsync up to version 0.9.0.  The
        current version of this package does not implement the rsync network protocol
        and uses a delta format slightly more efficient than and incompatible with
        rsync 2.4.6. '
