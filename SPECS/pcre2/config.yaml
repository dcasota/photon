      detailed_description: 'The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement
        regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
        Perl 5. PCRE2 has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions
        that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. It comes in three forms,
        for processing 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, in either literal or UTF
        encoding. '
