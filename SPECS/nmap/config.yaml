      detailed_description: 'nmap is a utility for network exploration or security
        auditing. It supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
        scanning techniques (determine what services the hosts are offering), and
        TCP/IP fingerprinting (remote host operating system identification). Nmap
        also offers flexible target and port specification, decoy scanning, determination
        of TCP sequence predictability characteristics, reverse-identd scanning, and
        more. In addition to the classic command-line nmap executable, the Nmap suite
        includes a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (netcat
        utility ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (ndiff), and a packet
        generation and response analysis tool (nping) '
