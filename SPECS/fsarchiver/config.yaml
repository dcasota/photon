      detailed_description: 'FSArchiver is a system tool that allows you to save the
        contents of a file-system to a compressed archive file. The file-system can
        be restored on a partition which has a different size and it can be restored
        on a different file-system. Unlike tar/dar, FSArchiver also creates the file-system
        when it extracts the data to partitions. Everything is checksummed in the
        archive in order to protect the data. If the archive is corrupt, you just
        loose the current file, not the whole archive. Fsarchiver is released under
        the GPL-v2 license. You should read the Quick start guide if you are using
        FSArchiver for the first time. '
