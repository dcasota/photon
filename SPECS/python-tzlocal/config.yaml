      detailed_description: "This Python module returns a tzinfo object with the local\
        \ timezone information under Unix and Win-32. It requires pytz, and returns\
        \ pytz tzinfo objects. This module attempts to fix a glaring hole in pytz,\
        \ that there is no way to get the local timezone information, unless you know\
        \ the zoneinfo name, and under several Linux distros that\u2019s hard or impossible\
        \ to figure out. Also, with Windows different timezone system using pytz isn\u2019\
        t of much use, unless you separately configure the zoneinfo timezone name.\
        \ With tzlocal you only need to call get_localzone(), and you will get a tzinfo\
        \ object with the local time zone info. On some Unices you will still not\
        \ get to know what the timezone name is, but you don\u2019t need that when\
        \ you have the tzinfo file. However, if the timezone name is readily available\
        \ it will be used. "
